        <h3 id="intro"> Introduction </h3>
        <p> Over the past two years, I've had multiple opportunities to learn and employ learning theories in school and in work. I've encountered two different learning theory camps that are more similar than credited, although they belong to different groups. First is information literacy within librarianship, and second is interpretation through California State Parks. Both are useful in creating fruitful learning experiences for individuals and groups. </p>
        <p> Arghode et al. (2017) compare four learning theories: "behaviorism, cognitivism, humanism and constructivism," and assess the role of each theory in improving online instruction (p. 595). Each learning theory focuses on a different aspect of the learner (Arghode et al., 2017, p. 596): </p>
            <ul> 
                <li> Behaviorism focuses on learning by response to external stimuli </li>
                <li> Cognitivism focuses on how information is stored in the mind</li>
                <li> Constructivism focuses on learners' internal motivations and willingness to learn </li>
                <li> Humanism emphasizes on adults taking ownership of learning </li>
            </ul> 
        <p> Each learning theory draws a different line between learner awareness and instructor effectiveness. This serves as a reminder that both the instructor and the learner work together to create an effective learning experience. Behaviorism and cognitivism place more responsibility on learners, since the learner needs to acknowledge the information or stimuli around them (and the instructor is responsible for providing this information or stimuli in an approachable way). In contrast, constructivism and humanism place more responsibility on instructors, who can present information in a motivating and engaging way (although learners are responsible for listening to this information as it is presented to them). Despite the differences between these learning theories, they all share in common a "learning environment" that involves the learner, instructor, and any materials used to explain the learned content. </p> 
        <p> Alongside these four learning theories, the AASL (American Association of School Librarians) created a learning framework that outlines how people learn new things thoroughly. According to the AASL, people learn through specific actions: thinking, creating, sharing, and growing. The AASL also provides examples for ways poeple can employee these four actions in the learning process. The AASL learning framework is important for creating full learning experiences, because librarians can incorporate exercises in which students or patrons perform each step of the learning process, until they reach a strong understanding a concept. </p>
        <p> Another learning theory I find important is interpretation, a practice employed by California State Parks to connect visitors to nature and history. Interpreters are state parks employees who instruct the public on lessons about their park. As a park aide at Sutter's Fort State Historic Park, I learned and practiced "interpretation" of our Fort's history, and have found a lot of crossover between it and the teaching values taught in librarianship. Instruction in libraries and interpretation in state parks are both centered around helping a visitor learn to ask questions, notice details around them, and appreciate something with which they are unfamiliar. </p>
        <p> In the <i> Basic Interpretation Learning System </i> handbook, different learning styles are associated with visitors of different ages. These learning styles often dictate which programs we offer for youth visiting state parks. We most often see youth ages 7-11 years old on field trips at the fort, and so our tours and history lessons are centered around channeling their youthful curiosity. </p>
        <ul> 
            <li> Kids 2-6: Learning through play. </li>
            <li> Youth 7-11: Curiosity and making connections drives learning. </li>
            <li> Youth 12-14: Guiding the discovery on their own, with your help. </li>
            <li> Teens and young adults: Forming values systems that last a lifetime. </li>
        </ul>
        <p> In state parks interpretation, employees are taught that "people forget facts, but they remember a good theme and the supporting subthemes" (BILS, 2012, p. 191). This is a good balance to the learning theories I've learned in graduate school. Not everyone needs to learn information to the same extent, and knowing when and for whom to tilt an interpretor's cap rather than a librarian's glasses is essential to me as an interdisciplinary librarian. While the learning theories are intended to help instructors understand how people learn and understand information, interpretation is not results oriented, and is instead centered around helping visitors build connections and values. I intend to continue employing both types of learning theory into my library instruction. </p>

        <h3 id="evidence"> Evidence </h3>

        <h4> 1) My first piece of evidence is a split-screen tutorial video and essay I created in INFO 254: Information Literacy. </h4>
        <a href="https://ischoolsjsu.libwizard.com/id/84a98b2f87a389436241e155dc1f87c6"> <img src="images/quiz.png" style="width:150px; height:150px; display: block;"> </img> Zotero tutorial on Libwizard </a>
        <a href="includes/zoterotutorial.pdf"> <img src="images/mail.png" style="width:150px; height:150px; display: block;"> Accompanying paper on learning theories </a>
        <p> For INFO 254: Information Literacy, I worked in a two-person group to create this split-screen tutorial, an online, synchronous or asynchronous teaching tool. My role in this project was to create the initial and final surveys, as well as the infographics accompanying the questions that my partner wrote. My partner recorded the three tutorial videos and edited our questions. On my own, I wrote the accompanying essay on the learning theories which inspired me and my partner to create our tutorial. </p>
        <p> I included this group project in this competency to demonstrate my understanding of learning theories and how they inform library instruction. I phrased the questions and responses in this Zotero tutorial to lead participants to automatically, without intention, think critically about the information given to them. Phrases leading to critical thinking include: </p>

        <ul>
            <li> "rank the following..."</li>
            <li> "which do you prefer..." </li>
            <li> "which of the following interests you..." </li>
            <li> "in what situation(s) could you use ________?" </li>
            <li> "which picture shows..." </li> 
        </ul> 
        <p> Each of these question starters encourage a viewer to focus on what they already know about themselves and the information in the question. Most of these questions don't have one singular correct answer. Instead, these questions ask the participant about themselves, which encourages them to stay engaged, as well as qualifies as the "curate" step of the AASL learning framework: "to make meaning for oneself by...sharing sources of personal relevance" (p. 5). Finally, the phrase "which picture shows" indicates that the answer is somewhere in the question, and directs the users to the spot where they can search for the answer. By including colorful graphics, I also am proud that of the brightly colored infographics that accompany the questions. These are also meant to capture the attention of tutorial participants. I included this tutorial and the accompanying paper (I turned both in together, the tutorial link is in the paper) as examples of learning experiences based on learning theories because each aspect of our work was created to support participants eager to learn about Zotero. </p> <br>

        <h4> 2) My second piece of evidence is a set of reviews I received for individual tutoring sessions in the library. </h4> 
        <a href="includes/tutoring/review.html"> <img src="images/mail.png" style="width:150px; height:150px; display: block;"> Tutoring review </img> </a>
        <!--<a href="includes/tutoring2/review.html"> <img src="images/mail.png" style="width:150px; height:150px; display: block;"> Tutoring review </img> </a> -->
        <p> As a library assistant, I offer tutoring sessions for students twice a week. I chose to include this piece of evidence because in this student's review, they highlighted a learning strategy that we covered, and wrote that they appreciated it and will use it in the future. This student wasn't aware that their teacher would share the review with me, making the feedback feel genuine. To me, this review represents reassurance that my efforts to integrate learning theories into my tutoring sessions are in fact helping students learn more ways to learn. </p>
        <p> Upon meeting with this student for our tutoring session and reviewing their paper, I asked them what they wanted to improve. The student explained to me that they didn't know how to include their professor's feedback, which was to clarify what a particular paragraph was about and to more strongly argue its relevance to the paper, into their final draft. After reading this paragraph, I knew its evidence and analysis was relevant to the paper, and could tell what this student meant to say through their slightly disorganized writing. I was excited, because I knew this student needed a skill or exercise to self-reflect upon their writing. </p>
        <p> This was an opportunity to create a "cognitive" and "humanist" learning experience: this student needed adjust how their thoughts and learned information was stored in their mind through self-reflection, and needed to take the responsibility to do this on their own in order to properly edit their work. </p>
        <p> I determined that this student would benefit from explaining aloud what he wanted to explain in his paper. After explaining to me what he wanted to say, it became much clearer what was missing from their paper, and they immediately started typing it out. This is one of my favorite tutoring sessions I've done, it was particularly fruitful for the student. At the time, I was unaware that this student was required to attend one of our tutoring sessions and review their paper, after which they submitted a reflection on the session to their professor. I am grateful they chose to include our learning strategy of self-reflection and editing through speech. This reflection supports this competency by showing that I can apply learning strategies to design individual learning experiences. </p> <br>
        
        <h4> 3) My third piece of evidence is a book talk that I wrote and recorded for INFO 281. </h4>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GqMKgLeFrDA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p> For INFO 281-12, I created this book talk entitled: "Booktalk! Real stories that are stranger than fiction" in order to spark an interest in reading in my viewers, and to introduce new books to interested readers. In this book talk, I showcase five biographies related by a similar theme: each presents a situation or person that is so strange and unusual that that they appear to be stranger than fiction. I spent about three minutes presenting a hook and synopsis for each book. </p>
        <p> While writing and recording this booktalk, I had in mind multiple learning theories which guided my talking points. I considered constructivism, and the viewer's internal motivations for watching my video; to provide extra motivation, I included a hook for this booktalk, and provided a name which would attract viewers who like biographies and interesting stories from history. Another learning theory I considered was humanism, the idea that learners should take responsibility of learning for themselves. By giving a book talk, a librarian helps learners by showing what they find interesting in a set of books, and encouraging viewers to go get these books, either from a library or store. When I made my book talk, I kept in mind the BILS statement that youth learn in an environment of guided discovery. Book talks are an example of guided discovery: while watching a book talk, the viewer will likely feel like they have discovered a book, when the librarian making the book talk was the person who introduced the book to the viewer. I included this book talk as an example of a specific (collaborative or individual) learning experience: helping youth discover and learn what they like and dislike in books. </p> <br>

        <h3 id="conclusion"> Conclusion </h3>
        <p> In the future, I am eager to apply the learning principles I've learned in the past two years to my work as a library professional. In particular, I am excited to apply the interpretation learning principles adopted by the California State Parks system to the library, including: roving and orienting. I have experience teaching students in formal sessions, but want to expand to informal (but deliberate and planned) moments of learning with a wider range of patrons. At Sutter's Fort State Park, I use roving and orienting to help patrons gain an interest in the materials and content around them. These same skills can be used in the library to help spark an interest in books and resources which patrons may not have previously considered. Additionally, I am continually working to improve my programming abilities. In the future, with more practice and experience, I hope to improve my tutoring and workshop hosting skills. I specifically plan to improve my speech by limiting my need to say 'um,' and being mindful of where my cursor is when moving through slideshows. As I repeat my workshops, I find areas that I can simplify and make clearer, which helps capture the attention of workshop participants. Finally, I hope to incorporate more technology and tools into my workshops to make them more interactive. I would like students to be able to participate more in the workshops I lead. </p> <br>
