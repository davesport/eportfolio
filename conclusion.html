        <h3> Definition: </h3>
        <p> Here are my final thoughts and reflections on my work in SJSU's MLIS program. </p> <br>

    <h3> My final thoughts:</h3>
    <img src="images/liberry_crop.png" style="max-width: 100%; height:auto;"> </img>
    <p> In INFO 203, when we made our wordpress blog, I created this image as my blog banner. Summed up in this picture are my values: creativity, exploration, imagination, and nature appreciation. In this program, I've learned a lot of new skills. I've also learned how to apply my own values to librarianship. </p> <br>

    <p style="display:block;"> <span style="font-weight:bolder;"> Left: In this blog post, Luke Burgis wrote as advice to "live out your personal vocation." </span> He further explains that "When you have a mission, it begins to act like an interpretative key to everything and allows you to know what to pay attention to" (<a href="https://read.lukeburgis.com/p/25-anti-mimetic-ideas?s=r">The Fourth Wall</a>). This blog post may require a subscription to read. If so: to the left is a picture of the section I reference here. I do feel like librarianship is my "interpretive key to everything." I really enjoy hobbies like running, playing the piano, gardening, and hiking. I also enjoy participating in my science fiction writing group, and making art projects with my sister. In these extra-curriculars, I find myself employing the concepts that I learned in reference and information literacy, where we discussed how to 'determine the patron's real question' and how to teach patrons how to teach themselves. I also have learned to embrace my interdisciplinary side. I studied the health sciences and history in college, and didn't expect these interests to overlap in a future career. Except that now, I am a library assistant at a health sciences college, and I get to create projects like "health heroes from history." Librarianship has combined many aspects of my life into one common thread. </p>
   
    <h4> Skills I use most: </h4>
    <p> I'm grateful for the skills I've learned in this program: library instruction and reference, advocacy, patron assistance, and coding. I've learned that instructing is different than lecturing: library instruction is interactive and engaging and makes learning a more natural process. I also learned that librarians need to advocate for their library and its resources. In two courses, booktalking & booktrailering and reference services, I learned how to use my creative side in library outreach, and how to encourage patrons to participate in library services. </p>

    <h4> My favorite courses: </h4>
    <ul>
        <li> INFO 254: Information literacy & learning </li>
        <li> INFO 210: Reference services </li>
        <li> INFO 240: Information technology, tools & applications (HTML & CSS) </li>
        <li> INFO 246-11: (SQL, Python, Javascript & PHP) </li>
        <li> INFO 285: Applied research methods: Research in academic libraries </li>
    </ul> 

    <h4> Workplaces where I've used the skills taught in this program: </h4>
    <ul> 
        <li> Customer service employee (2015 - 2019) </li>
        <li> Substitute teaching (2020) </li>
        <li> Library assistant - Health sciences undergraduate program </li>
        <li> Park aide - CA State Parks (Sutter's Fort & State Indian Museum) </li>
    </ul>

    <h4> Thanks for reading! </h4>
    <img src="images/bye.png" style="width:150px; height:150px; float:left; padding-right:20px;"> 
    <p style="display:block;"> I hope my experience in this program can help someone else. I am really grateful that this online MLIS program exists and that I've made it through. I look forward to the next step in my library career. </p>
