        <h3> Welcome! </h3>
        <p> This is my e-portfolio site, published (privately) on Github, for free. I made this site using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, which I learned in three web development courses in SJSU's MLIS program. I wrote my HTML and CSS on Visual Studio Code, a free computer app. </p> <br>
        <h3> Navigation: </h3>
        <p> <span style="font-weight: bolder"> The navigation bar </span> at the top of the page contains links to each page of my portfolio. This bar is in the same place on each page. </p>
        <p> Within each page, there is a <span style="font-weight: bolder"> sidebar to the left </span> (same as this sidebar) that defines and outlines each competency. Click the quick links there to jump to a particular part of a competency. </p>
        <p> My <span style="font-weight: bolder"> contact information </span> is listed at the bottom of each page. </p> 
        <p> This website has a <span style="font-weight: bolder"> responsive layout </span> to different screen widths, which means that the layout of each page will change as your screen or browser width changes (in order to better suit your screen size). </p><br>
        <h3> Contents: </h3>
        <p> My portfolio contains an introduction, conclusion, and competencies A-O, which break down what I have learned and practiced in this program into thematic groups. </p> <br>

        <h3> Introduction </h3>
        <img class="sadielibrary" src="images/sadieinthelibrary.jpg"> Me (Sadie) in the library. </img>
        <p> Here I am, in the library! This photo is a good introduction to who I am as a library professional. This photo shows my workplace, which is important to me. I am a library assistant at California Northstate University in Rancho Cordova, California. I started working in this position at the same time I started the program: August 2020. Much of the evidence and learning experiences I gained outside of this MLIS program, I gained through my experience here in this library, by working in the field. </p>
