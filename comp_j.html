        <h3 id="intro"> Introduction </h3>  
        <p> Library and information science scholars have identified and explained several information-seeking behaviors. The existence of different information-seeking behaviors proves that there isn't one "correct" way to seek information. Instead, library and information professionals should be aware of many information-seeking behaviors and help patrons act upon the behavior (or a set of behaviors) that best suits them. Together, these information-seeking behaviors indicate that it is okay to feel a variety of emotions when seeking information, to want increased access to information, to feel overwhelmed when faced with a large amount of information, and to seek information on a wide variety of topics. First, I will explain seven different information-seeking behaviors in chronological order, based on when they were published. Then, I will demonstrate my understanding of these different behaviors with assignments and work relevant to the different information-seeking behaviors. </p>    
        <h4 id="1"> Berrypicking (1989) </h4>
        <p> Marcia Bates describes "berrypicking" as "a bit-at-a-time retrieval," in which an information seeker comes to understand a topic by finding small pieces of information that guide them toward other, increasingly relevant pieces of information (Fig 1). The journey overall is what helps the seeker most, rather than an end-all list of resources. Bates includes Figure 2 (below) in her article, which shows information-seeking to be a more "evolving search" rather than a linear one (Fig. 2). 
            <div style="padding:10px;"> <img src="images/berrypicking_fig2.png" style="width:50%; height:auto;"> </div>
        <h4 id="2"> A Holistic Information Search Process (1993) </h4>
        <p> Kuhlthau (1993) argues that "library and information systems...ignore the holistic experience of information seeking" (352). Kuhlthau references other Yovits et al. who state that "in some situations infromation may make a person more uncertain of his or her appraisal of a situation" and that "typical decision models address those who are assumed to have reached a rather advanced state of knowledge about the decision situation in question" (346). As a result, Kuhlthau created her own information search process, based on covering "all stages of decision-making" (346). Included below is a diagram including Kuhthau's six steps of the information seeking process, as well as the "three realms of human experience: the affective (feelings), the cognitive (thoughts), and the physical (actions)" which seekers may find themselves in (Fig 1).
            <div style="padding:10px;"> <img src="images/kuhlthau_isp.png" style="width:50%; height:auto;"> </div>
        <h4 id="3"> Everyday life information seeking (1995) </h4>
        <p> Savolainen (1995) combats the idea that information-seeking behavior is reserved only for research, scholarly, or professional purposes. Instead, Savolainen argues that everyday life information seeking helps the general public achieve a "mastery of life," in which they are informed on several different topics, including "healthcare, hobbies," culture, current events, and more (p. 259). Someone who has as mastery of life is able to "[keep] things in order." Applying information-seeking behavior to other aspects of life besides work and school is extremely important, particularly with the motivation of improving one's life. </p>
        <h4 id="4"> Life in the Round (1998) </h4> 
        <p> Chatman (1998) addresses information-seeking behavior within a different environment: one in which people have to overcome what Chatman calls "information poverty" (p. 207). Chatman argues that one's location, environment, social norms, and life experiences shape the ways they seek information. In an interview with a prisoner, Chatman includes the following quote: "Instead of girls making memories outside or doing things that can assist them once they get outside [prison], the prison becomes their own world" (p. 208). This is an example of Chatman's theory of "information poverty:" for this prisoner and others around her, new, useful information that would help these prisoners grow is inaccessible. </p>
        <h4 id="5"> Information encountering (2005) </h4>
        <p> Erdelez (2005) supports Bates's theory of "berrypicking" when discussing "information encountering." Like Bates, Erdelez counters the idea of linear information seeking and understanding. However, Erdelez differs from Bates when she discusses how finding information isn't always intentional, and patrons are likely to bump into information that proves useful to them. Erdelez calls the process of unintentionally finding useful information "information encountering" (p. 25). Erdelez also discusses patrons' moods and dispositions as a factor in their ability to find information (p. 26). She argues there is a range of information encounterers from those who don't engage in encountering information, to those who consider it a coincidence, to those who count on encountering tbe information they need. Included below is Figure 1 from Erdelez's article (2005, p. 26). </p>
        <div style="padding:10px;"> <img src="images/erdelez_fig1.png" style="width:50%; height:auto;"> </div>
        <h4 id="6"> Radical change theory (2009) </h4>
        <p> Dresang's "radical change theory" is that youth in the digital age have "new information behaviors" that information professionals should understand and embrace (p. 26). Dresang states that "the theory of Radical Change is based on the digital age principles of interactivity, connectivity and access" (p. 27). Interactivity refers to how users can seek information anytime, anywhere. Connectedness refers to users who seek information socially, among a group of people who offer input on a topic. And access means that in the digital realm, people have multiple different ways of locating and interacting with information, in groups, on different forums, and from different sources. With an increasing amount of information available in different forms, digital-age youth have "interactive, nonlinear, and multitasking approaches" to seeking information in a digital environment (p. 32). Below is Dresang's "Model of a proposed research agenda applying radical change theory" (Fig. 1, p. 44).
            <div style="padding:10px;"> <img src="images/dresang_fig1.png" style="width:50%; height:auto;"> </div>
        <h4 id="7"> ACRL Framework for information literacy for higher education </h4>
        <p> Although information literacy is not necessarily an information-seeking behavior, I would argue that it fits this ongoing list of information-seeking behaviors because it expands upon the ideas presented in Dresang's "radical change theory." Librarians and educators who teach information literacy teach "active learning approaches that require students to engage with information in ways that are new to them" (Maybee, 2016). By teaching students new methods of information engagement, educators encourage students to embrace the digital age, use new search techniques and behaviors, and become better critical thinkers. In this way, information literacy is a skill that people can gain by becoming more comfortable with their information search behaviors. I believe that information literacy is essential to the future of librarianship and education.</p>
        <p> The ACRL has outlined "six concepts that anchor" its overall framework: (p. 8). </p> 
        <ul>
            <li> Authority is constructed and contextual </li>
            <li> Information creation as a process </li> 
            <li> Information has value </li>
            <li> Research as inquiry </li>
            <li> Scholarship as conversation </li>
            <li> Searching as strategic exploration </li>
        </ul> 
        <p> If those seeking information can engage in the six concepts listed above, then "consumers and creators of information...can participate successfully in collaborative spaces" (p. 8). On databases, social media platforms, and other sources of information online, collaborative spaces are increasingly common. Additionally, misinformation is becoming increasingly common online, shared among creators and consumers of information alike, and information literacy empowers information seekers to discern between reliable and unreliable pieces of information. By continuing to teach information literacy by the ACRL framework, educators (including librarians) can help students and library patrons choose their information behaviors more deliberately. </p><br>
        <h3 id="evidence"> Evidence </h3>
            <h4> 1) Video & Paper: Database tutorial </h4>
            <div style="float:left; padding-right:15px; text-align:center;"> <a href="https://sjsu.instructuremedia.com/embed/0be66709-e5f0-4372-9262-4101f6c3e548">  <img src="images/tv.png" style="width:150px; height:150px; display:block; padding-right:20px;"> Video tutorial </img> </a> </div>
            <div><a href="includes/Applying Learning Theory to Practice Screencasts.pdf"> <img src="images/mail.png" style="width:150px; height:150px; display:block;"> Accompanying paper</img> </a></div>
            <p> My first piece of evidence is a tutorial video I created in INFO 254: Information literacy. I created this tutorial video and wrote an accompanying essay to teach students and faculty how to use a particular database offered by the library I work for as a library assistant. </p>
            <p> In this video, I cover the purpose of Ovid Linksolver, how it's different from other databases, and three different ways that users can search for journals in this database. The three ways are suited for three different purposes. First, users can search for a specific journal in an alphabetical index. Second, users can search for journals with a specific term or phrase in the database search bar. Third, users can browse through lists of journals organized by topic and sub-topics.Once a user clicks on a journal, they can browse through its volumes, issues, and individual articles. </p> 
            <p> When assigned this tutorial video project, I thought of the many students and faculty at my college library who were completely unfamiliar with the database "Ovid Linksolver". This database organizes its information differently than most other databases. It is an index of journals and their volumes, issues, and individual articles. Users cannot search for specific articles here. However, I have found that this database can provide useful information. I've helped faculty and students learn more about the scope, reliability, and longevity of different journals. What is more important, and is the reason for this tutorial video, is influencing information-seeking behavior. By becoming more familiar with the different ways databases are organized, students and faculty can view databases as a means, not an end, to research. </p>
            <p> I included this piece of evidence in this competency because this tutorial video is intended to help improve students' and faculty's information-seeking behaviors.</p>

            <h4> 2) Presentation: Database Search Tips! </h4>

            <p> My second piece of evidence is a slideshow entitled: "Using the Library Databases! For simple, thorough, and engaging research at CNSU!" </p>
            <p> As a library assistant, I wrote and used this slideshow to lead an online library workshop. The purpose of this workshop was to introduce undergraduate students to the databases and simple search techniques they can use to find the information they need.</p>

            </ul>
            <p> My goal with this presentation was to show students what's "out there" on our library databases. I would say this learning experience promotes information-seeking behavior most similar to Bates's <span style="font-weight:bolder;"> "berrypicking" </span> behavior. By seeing lots of different kinds of information and multimedia, students can pick and choose what they want to use, and switch between sources often. Additionally, in my own experience conducting academic research in college, my tutoring experiences at this library, and even my experiences seeking information on health topics, music, books, and hobbies, I find myself teaching from <span style="font-weight:bolder;">Kuhlthau's holistic information search process </span>in this workshop. With students in this workshop, I talk about the difference between "exploring" information and "documenting" information, as Kuhlthau does in her model. I've found in tutoring that when college students skip the "exploring" step, they're often reading new information for the first time, and trying to immediately document this new information in an academic, well-written essay. This can be incredibly discouraging and overwhelming. By going through the different places to search, a series of search steps, and example searches, I show students alternative information-seeking behaviors. </p>
            <p> I included this piece of evidence to show that I can teach beneficial information-seeking behaviors to students by using what I've learned in this MLIS program and applying it to the field! </p>

            <h4> 3) Essay: Practice reference service </h4>
            <a href="includes/unit-6.pdf"> <img src="images/mail.png" style="width:150px; height:150px; display:block;"> Reference questions & my responses </img> </a>
            <p> My third piece of evidence is an assignment I completed in INFO 210: Reference and information services. In this assignment, I was tasked to answer three practice reference questions. </p>
            <p> In this course, we learned that reference service in libraries has changed over time to encompass in-depth questions, particularly since the start of the digital age. There is also an art to fully answering a patron's reference question, as the patron doesn't know what information the reference librarian needs to find relevant answers. As a result, a reference interview is first conducted, and the reference librarian begins by asking questions about the patron's question that can help the librarian best understand the patron's needs. This interview also needs to be engaging, respectful, and enthusiastic. The librarian and the patron are on the same team, and have a mutual goal to locate answers to a particular question. </p>
            <p> This assignment relates to information-seeking behavior because a patron is demonstrating information-seeking behavior by asking a librarian for help, and as a result, the reference librarian will need to seek information themselves. By asking a productive series of questions (in the form of a natural conversation), the reference librarian is showing the patron how to pinpoint useful details that can get them closer to the answers they need. And when sharing answers and information with the patron, they can explain: why certain sources are more reliable, how to navigate different sources of information, and additional topics they may decide to pursue further. </p>
            <p> I included this piece of evidence in order to demonstrate my ability to help spatrons' seek information on different subjects. </p> 

            <h4> 4) Essay: Virtual reference evaluation </h4> 
            <a href="includes/virtualref.pdf"> <img src="images/mail.png" style="width:150px; height:150px; display:block;"> Virtual Reference Evaluation. </img> </a>
            <p> This fourth piece of evidence is an essay I wrote in INFO 210: Reference services, in which I evaluated Sacramento Public Library's (SPL's) virtual reference service. </p> 
            <p> In order to complete this essay and to evaluate SPL's virtual reference service, I went undercover and used SPL's virtual reference service as a patron, twice. Each time, in the virtual chatbox on the SPL website, I started with a broad question that came to my mind, and found myself asking more questions as the reference librarian pointed me closer to what I wanted. The two reference librarians who worked with me were kind, enthusiastic, and patient. They helped "negotiate the question" by asking follow-up, clarifying questions, and I quickly found the information I wanted (RUSA). Each step in the conversation is included in the PDF, as well as screenshots from my chats. </p>
            <p> Virtual reference services are an incredibly valuable resource for information seekers. I messaged SPL reference librarians on my phone, and navigated the SPL website with their help on my phone. I was able to ask my questions on a whim, and without fear of judgment, rather than approaching a reference desk potentially with fear and trepidation. Also, I didn't have to be a library patron to use this virtual chat feature. If patrons use this virtual reference chat, they will become more familiar with the library and its librarians, as well as more confident in their ability to seek information. </p> 
            <p> I included this piece of evidence in this competency as an example of how new technology is providing new ways for patrons to seek out information. Virtual reference chat is easy, fast, approachable, and highly accessible. </p> <br>
        
        <h3 id="conclusion"> Conclusion </h3>
        <p> By understanding different information-seeking behaviors, library professionals and educators are better equipped to assist members of the general public in becoming critical thinkers, understanding what they need, exploring different sources of information, and overcoming negative emotional and mental states. Through my MLIS coursework and work as an academic library assistant, I have had the opportunity to learn different information-seeking behaviors and to apply this knowledge in workshops I teach. I also have learned how to use strategic follow-up questions in tutoring and reference services in order to determine what a patron is really seeking. Finally, these information-seeking behaviors are continually changing with the introduction of new technology. This calls for information professionals and educators to teach information literacy, which equips students with information-seeking, discerning, evaluating, and sharing skills. This way, information seekers can apply what they knew to new library services, like virtual reference. </p>
