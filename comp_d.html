        <h3 id="intro"> Introduction </h3>
        <p> Planning, management, marketing and advocacy are part of the librarian's everyday work responsibilities.  These four actions are often completed among a group. Each step is separate: "planning" refers to preparing and outlining the steps needed to complete a library project; "management" refers to the leadership needed to pull the library project forward; “marketing” refers to the outreach and communication done to get patrons involved in the project; and “advocacy” refers to the support shown for a project upon its completion. Together, these four steps combine to connect library staff to their visitors and encourage them to use their library's resources. </p>
        <p> As a student, I learned how to plan, manage, market and advocate for various library programs and services. As a library assistant and student chapter board member, I performed each of these actions on a regular basis. Between school, extracurriculars and work, I have greatly improved my understanding and experience with these four tasks, and see them as a larger process, with an end goal of motivating visitors to reach out and grab the information and services they need. </p>
        <p> The following sections highlight my involvement in planning, management, marketing, and advocacy in the library. </p> <br>

        <h4 id="plan"> Planning: </h4> 
        <a href="includes/alasc_oct.pdf"> <img src="images/mail.png" style="width:150px; height:150px; display: block;"> ALASC October 2021 agenda.</a> </img>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;"> About ALASC & my role as a board member:</p>
        <p> In the ALA student chapter (ALASC), we spend most of our time planning. In contrast to our events which each span a single night, planning in ALASC takes months of consistent effort. When our project planning is extensive, thorough, and started early, the work needed to complete the project feels easier and more manageable. Every action we do on behalf of ALASC is planned. From my experiences as a board member, I have learned that planning is necessary for: event logistics, communication, group dynamics, potential problems & solutions, assessment, and growth (or expansion). Someone who excels at planning these different aspects of a group would make an effective manager. </p>
        <p> The work required to run ALASC is split between different executive board groups, including: the social media team, events team, archives team, and blogging team. Each ALASC group contributes plans of their own to monthly meetings, and together with the help of the chair, co-chair and faculty advisor, we make sure our groups are working together. I was elected co-chair. These steps in the planning process are what enable our large group of executive board members to continue working productively and with clear intention. </p> 
        <p> <span style="font-weight: bold"> Above is one of our ALA student chapter monthly meeting agendas.</span> It is an example of how our group discusses upcoming events and how we start the planning process early. Each month, I assist the chair in determining what should be on each agenda, how much time should be allotted for each agenda section, and how updates, news and voting items should be shared with the executive board. Together, Carlos, the ALASC chair, and I typed the content listed in this October agenda. There are several items listed on this agenda for us to discuss and plan, despite being months away at the time, including: the events planned for November, the end-of-the-semester hangout in December, the book giveaway in spring 2022, and the SCOTYA (student chapter of the year award) 2022 application due in March 2022. </p> 
        <p> In addition to planning out what the agenda contains, I hold responsibilities during the meeting that are listed on this agenda. In this agenda, it's written for me to speak about my progress assisting the blogging team under the "website/blogging report," updating the blogging schedule under the "website/blogging report," and planning consistent check-ins in "order of business" section. These are the areas where I worked with members of the executive board. ALASC's monthly agendas serve to ensure we are operating as previously planned, offer a space to assess ongoing plans, and communicate with one another regarding future plans. Because our executive board members largely work independently, these monthly meetings are essential to maintaining our organizational structure. </p> 

        <h4 id="manage"> Management: </h4>
        <a href="includes/\mzuzufire_259.pdf"> <img src="images/mail.png" id="mzuzu" style="width:150px; height:150px; display: block;"> Mzuzu University Library fire </a> </img> 
        <p> In the SJSU MLIS program, I learned how management can change the course of a library project. Since effective management requires experience in the library and experience as a manager, I have turned toward my MLIS education for lessons and examples. In my course on preservation management, I had the opportunity to research the Mzuzu University Library fire. The sources of information regarding the fire evaluated the library's management, I learned through my research how errors in management led to extensive damage to this library’s collection and infrastructure. However, the Mzuzu Library staff members enacted a plan set prior to the disaster, and were able to recover from this disaster within three years. From this, I have learned that quick responses, management guides, and proper delegation of tasks is essential to good management. </p>
        <p> <spam style="font-weight: bold"> Summary of my paper:</spam> The 2015 Mzuzu Library fire caused over seven million dollars in damage, made worse by bystander interference and disorganization at the scene of the fire (Davenport, p. 1). In contrast, the Mzuzu Library staff worked quickly, by an existing plan to prepare an interim library and to restore the library's physical, technological and digital resources. Interestingly, the management of the library prior to the 2015 fire affected its ability to recover from the disaster. Additionally, opposing perceptions of the interim Mzuzu Library (post-fire) stem from opposing perceptions of this library's management; while authors Chawinga & Majawa (2018) speak positively about the Mzuzu University Library's management team and progress since 2015, authors Chipeta et al. (2018), and Chaputula (2011) analyze its shortcomings in both management and progress. </p> 
        <p> Many aspects of the 2015 Mzuzu University Library fire required management: management planning, emergency response cooperation, risk assessment, disaster planning, budgeting, resource collection, training, policy establishment, communication and management assessment. </p>
            <ul> <span style="font-weight: bold"> Prior to the 2015 fire, the Mzuzu University Library did have: </span> 
                <li> A disaster response plan (page 1) </li>
                <li> Staff to lead and enact the disaster response plan </li>
            </ul>
            <ul> <span style="font-weight: bold"> Prior to the 2015 fire, the Mzuzu University Library did not have: </span>
                <li> A reliable budget (page 4) </li>
                <li> A collection development policy (page 4) </li>
                <li> Sufficient access to technology & digital resources (page 2 & 3) </li>
            </ul>
            <ul> <span style="font-weight: bold"> After the 2015 fire, the Mzuzu Univreisty Library gained: </span>
                <li> Notoriety for quickly constructing an interim library (page 2) </li>
                <li> Increased communication among staff and students through smartphone apps (page 5) </li> 
                <li> An assessment of its organization, structure, and progress. </li>
            </ul>
        <p> From analyzing this library over a decade of its operation, I learned that management provides direction, for better or for worse, for libraries in the face of disaster. At the Mzuzu University Library, management was needed to guide library staff through a difficult transition to its interim library, and to continue providing resources for students. I also learned that assessments like those conducted by Chawinga & Majawa, Chaputula, and Chipeta et al. are useful in learning about real management strategies and experiences; Chaputula was a library assistant at Mzuzu University library and reported on her own experience, while the other scholars interviewed managers at the library for their experiences overseeing its daily operations. This essay was a unique opportunity to learn about a real library and its daily operations. While I don't have management experience yet, I credit the Mzuzu University Library with an introduction to all that management encompasses. </p> 

        <h4 id="market"> Marketing: </h4>
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cnulibrary/"> <img src="images/link.png" style="width:150px; height:150px; display: block;"> CNU Library Instagram page. </a> </img>
        <p> Here is the CNU library’s Instagram page. If you can't view the Instagram page from the website, click <a href="#pics"> here.</a> I created our account in January 2021, and have since made all of the posts on it since then. Our posts include promotions for on campus events, library events, library collection updates, database tutorials, local community showcasing, health heroes from history, important historical events in health science, and career planning resources. </p>
        <p> Marketing is essential to the success of a library project, because a project cannot happen without visitors participating in it. Additionally, sharing an upcoming event or service with potentially benefiting patrons is a positive action and when done effectively, can help patrons feel included and supported in their community. Marketing reflects on the library itself, and can give potential future patrons an image of what the library is like. </p>
        <p> Marketing has become an important aspect of my position at the CNU Library. Prior to my onboarding as their library assistant, the Rancho Cordova campus did not have any library staff members working at its campus. This led to students not understanding or trusting the databases, and not utilizing the resources that the library has to offer. My first goal was to help students trust the library. I learned how to communicate the library's strengths through effective marketing strategies: printed posters for the library walls, and social media posts on Instagram. </p>
        <p> By combining print and social media marketing strategies, I can ensure I reach as many students as possible. Only some follow our library Instagram page, but many more walk through the library space and see the posters I put up. And when I talk to professors, and they promote library services in their classrooms (or even require students to attend for credit), then even more students are introduced to our library services. By employing all three of these strategies, I can get a sense of what is most effective, how each marketing form is different, and what students respond to most. </p>

        <p> This slideshow contains images I designed on Canva, an online image editing & design website. Included in these images are Instagram posts and print images (noted) which I designed to market: 
            <ul> 
                <li> New database content </li>
                <li> New textbooks </li>
                <li> Upcoming library workshops </li>
                <li> General library resources </li>
                <li> Events on campus </li> 
                <li> Instagram page ad (print image) </li>
            </ul>
            <p> Click on the presentation above to view the speaker notes, which provide specific details for each instagram post. </p>
            <p> When designing each image for marketing purposes, I first consider what needs to be communicated and to whom. My main audience includes CNU students and faculty. As I come across library and campus updates useful for my audience, I determine how to effectively share them. Some items are best shared on Instagram, including gifs and videos. Some are best shared in print (on display in the library), for faculty members that don't use social media. Still images advertising events in the library and important updates are often shared both in print and on social media. </p> 
            <p> Each post design takes on average 1 hour to create, from the initial idea of the design to its publication on Instagram. I work hard to create images that are colorful and attention-grabbing, yet still readable. I also work to ensure my intended message is communicated clearly, and with a positive tone. </p>

        <h4 id="advocacy"> Advocacy </h4>
        <p> Click <a href="#advoc"> here</a> to view my work on advocacy through social media. </p>
        <p> Librarian Amanda Jones briefly summarizes “advocacy” in her article: “Posting about your school’s library programming is not bragging–it’s advocating. We should all be proud of what we do and what we offer our students, and social media is one of the easiest ways to do this” (Jones, p. 36). After my courses and work, I agree with Jones’s assertion that showing advocacy is a way of actively supporting an ongoing or completed library service. In this way, advocacy can be similar to marketing. The major difference between the two is that marketing is intended to provide the marketer with a direct benefit, while advocacy is intended to benefit someone else. Both are useful in involving patrons in library services. </p>
        <p>At my current library, I have learned that through advocacy, I can instill in students and faculty a sense of consistency, trust, and respect in their library. Since I work at a health sciences college, I find it extremely important to advocate for the health sciences and local health science communities, so that my students can envision a bright future for their education and career paths. I highlight features of our library that are available for students to use anytime; this is different from my result-oriented marketing, since I am trying to bolster this library’s reputation as a resourceful, helpful place. I have also communicated with other libraries through social media, and advocated for their services on my Instagram page. Advocacy is a great way to remind yourself why different library resources and external resources are beneficial to others, and why you are grateful for them. 
        </p> 
        <p id="advoc"> <span style="font-weight: bolder;"> Here are Instagram posts specifically advocating for:</span> </p>
        <ul>  
            <li> Other libraries' events and content </li>

        <p> Each image here was designed to advocate for a group providing helpful knowledge and support for health sciences students today. Anytime I came across information that I felt should be shared, I made a print source or social media post to share it. By adovcating for other libraries and community members, I involved the CNU Library within its larger community, and showed an appreciation for other hard workers local to our college. </p>

        <h3 id="conclusion"> Conclusion </h3>
        <p> Planning, management, marketing and advocacy are essential skills for every librarian. While each skill is distinct, altogether they form steps taken to connect users to their library. Planning and management are required to help a group of library professionals work together and better their library. Good library planning doesn't end, as seen by the evidenced ALASC monthly agenda. Instead, planning can form most of the work done in the library, and can lead a library to its desired goal through a lengthy series of small steps. Management includes the execution of a library's plans, through leadership and delegation. Management of the 2015 Mzuzu University Library fire and the library's restoration relied on prior planning as well as adaptations to new situations, including a new interim library and technological advancement. Marketing and advocacy are two ways to promote your library's services, and to show your pride for the library, respectively. To do each effectively, planning and management are required. Without marketing and advocacy, plans for library events and resources would be unfulfilled, since both steps connect library services with the patrons who would benefit from using them. By assessing my own marketing and advocacy tactics based on audience interaction and involvement, I continually learn about my students' wants and needs. Planning, management, marketing and advocacy are all important to the overall function of a library, from the start to end of each of is projects. </p>
