        <h3 id="intro"> Introduction </h3>
        <p> Planning, management, marketing and advocacy are part of the librarian's everyday work responsibilities.  These four actions are often completed among a group. Each step is separate: "planning" refers to preparing and outlining the steps needed to complete a library project; "management" refers to the leadership needed to pull the library project forward; “marketing” refers to the outreach and communication done to get patrons involved in the project; and “advocacy” refers to the support shown for a project upon its completion. Together, these four steps combine to connect library staff to their visitors and encourage them to use their library's resources. </p>
        <p> As a student, I learned how to plan, manage, market and advocate for various library programs and services. As a library assistant and student chapter board member, I performed each of these actions on a regular basis. Between school, extracurriculars and work, I have greatly improved my understanding and experience with these four tasks, and see them as a larger process, with an end goal of motivating visitors to reach out and grab the information and services they need. </p>
        <p> The following sections highlight my involvement in planning, management, marketing, and advocacy in the library. </p> <br> 

        <h3 id="plan"> Planning </h3>
        <p> Planning is a very broad term, and so it is important to note which aspects of the future require "planning." From my experience on the ALA student chapter board, I learned that the logistics of events require planning, as well as: communication, group dynamics, potential problems & solutions, assessment, and growth (or expansion). Someone who excels at planning these different aspects of a group would make an effective manager. </p> 
        <p> In the ALA student chapter (ALASC), we spend most of our time planning. The events we put on last merely hours, while the planning required to ensure they run smoothly extends back months prior. When our project planning is extensive, thorough, and started early, the work needed to complete the project feels easier and more manageable. The work required to run ALASC is split between different executive board groups, including: the social media team, events team, archives team, and blogging team. Each ALASC group contributes plans of their own to monthly meetings, and together with the help of the chair, co-chair and faculty advisor, we make sure our groups are working together. These steps in the planning process are what enable our large group of executive board members to continue working productively and with clear intention. </p>
        <h3 id="manage"> Management </h3>
        <p> In the SJSU MLIS program, I learned how management can change the course of a library project. Since effective management requires experience in the library and experience as a manager, I have turned toward my MLIS education for lessons and examples. In my course on preservation management, I had the opportunity to research the Mzuzu University Library fire. I learned through my research how errors in management led to extensive damage to this library’s collection and infrastructure. However, the Mzuzu Library staff members enacted a plan set prior to the disaster, and were able to recover from this disaster within three years. From this, I have learned that quick responses, management guides, and proper delegation of tasks is essential to good management. </p>
        <p> Many aspects of the 2015 Mzuzu University Library fire required management: emergency response cooperation, risk assessment, disaster planning, budgeting, resource collection, training, policy establishment, communication and assessment. The Mzuzu Library fire caused over seven million dollars in damage, which was made worse by bystander interference and disorganization at the scene of the fire (Davenport, p. 1). In contrast, Mzuzu Library staff worked quickly and by an existing plan to prepare an interim library and to restore the library's physical, technological and digital resources. Interestingly, the management of the library prior to the 2015 fire affected its ability to recover. This shows how management and planning overlap as supervisory, directional actions providing leadership over library staff groups.

        <h3 id="market"> Marketing </h3>
        <p> Marketing is essential to the success of a library project, because a project cannot happen without visitors participating in it. Additionally, sharing an upcoming event or service with potentially benefiting patrons is a positive action and when done effectively, can help patrons feel included and supported in their community. Marketing reflects on the library itself, and can give potential future patrons an image of what the library is like. </p>
        <p> Marketing has become an important aspect of my position at the CNU Library. Prior to my onboarding as their library assistant, the Rancho Cordova campus did not have any library staff members working at its campus. Their faculty and students learned to function with virtual assistance from the other campus. In my first conversation with the campus dean, she told me: "Thanks for whatever it is that you do." I needed to plant myself as a vital and essential member of this campus. And I needed to make the library a vital learning space. I learned how to communicate the library's strengths through effective marketing strategies. </p>
        <p> At the CNU library, I work with several different marketing mediums: social media, paper marketing, and word-of-mouth. By combining multiple different types of marketing strategies, I can ensure I reach as many students as possible. Only some follow our library Instagram page, but many more walk through the library space and see the posters I put up. And when I talk to professors, and they promote library services in their classrooms (or even require students to attend for credit), then even more students are introduced to our library services. By employing all three of these strategies, I can get a sense of what is most effective, how each marketing form is different, and what students respond to most. </p>

        <h3 id="advocacy"> Advocacy </h3>
        <p> Librarian Amanda Jones briefly summarizes “advocacy” in her article: “Posting about your school’s library programming is not bragging–it’s advocating. We should all be proud of what we do and what we offer our students, and social media is one of the easiest ways to do this” (Jones, p. 36). After my courses and work, I agree with Jones’s assertion that showing advocacy is a way of actively supporting an ongoing or completed library service. In this way, advocacy can be similar to marketing. The major difference between the two is that marketing is intended to provide the marketer with a direct benefit, while advocacy is intended to benefit someone else. Both are useful in involving patrons in library services. </p>

        <p>At my current library, I have learned that through advocacy, I can instill in students and faculty a sense of consistency, trust, and respect in their library. Since I work at a health sciences college, I find it extremely important to advocate for the health sciences and local health science communities, so that my students can envision a bright future for their education and career paths. I highlight features of our library that are available for students to use anytime; this is different from my result-oriented marketing, since I am trying to bolster this library’s reputation as a resourceful, helpful place. I have also communicated with other libraries through social media, and advocated for their services on my Instagram page. Advocacy is a great way to remind yourself why different library resources and external resources are beneficial to others, and why you are grateful for them.

        <h3 id="conclusion"> Conclusion </h3>
        <p> Planning, management, marketing and advocacy are essential skills for every librarian. While each skill is distinct, altogether they form steps taken to connect users to their library. Planning and management are required to help a group of library professionals work together and better their library. Good library planning doesn't end, as seen by the evidenced ALASC monthly agenda. Instead, planning can form most of the work done in the library, and can lead a library to its desired goal through a lengthy series of small steps. Management includes the execution of a library's plans, through leadership and delegation. Management of the 2015 Mzuzu University Library fire and the library's restoration relied on prior planning as well as adaptations to new situations, including a new interim library and technological advancement. Marketing and advocacy are two ways to promote your library's services, and to show your pride for the library, respectively. To do each effectively, planning and management are required. Without marketing and advocacy, plans for library events and resources would be unfulfilled, since both steps connect library services with the patrons who would benefit from using them. By assessing my own marketing and advocacy tactics based on audience interaction and involvement, I continually learn about my students' wants and needs. Planning, management, marketing and advocacy are all important to the overall function of a library, from the start to end of each of is projects. </p>
