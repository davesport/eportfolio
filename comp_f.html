        <h3 id="intro"> Introduction </h3>
        <p> Library collections consist of physical and digital information items. In order to maintain these collections, it is important for LIS professionals to understand how to select, evaluate, organize and preserve the items in their library's collections. For evidence that I have learned each of these aspects of collection management and maintenance, I included: an observation report on item selection, a paper on OAIS mapping (digital organization and preservation), a report on the organization and preservation of a physical library environment, and a preservation assessment of a museum and its collection. </p> 
        
        <h4>Selection: </h4> 
        <p> Selecting physical and digital items for a library collection is complicated. Physical items can include literature, as well as "things," including tools, technology and multimedia resources. Digital items also include literature, services, and multimedia resources. Selection for both physical and digital items is determined by relevance, patron need, library budget, and upkeep. </p>
        <p> Rice & Cummings (2020) state that digital items and physical tech items in the library should be selected based on: sustainability, user request, price, ease of use, format, software requirements, accessories, batteries (or lack thereof), support, training needs, and durability (Selection criteria). This list of criteria helps determine <i>which</i> devices to offer in the library. For example, most students have access to laptops at a university, and so laptops may not be as in-demand as other tech, including video cameras and 3D printers. However, 9% of students do not have access to laptops at university, and more may seek out library laptops for campus software installation (which may be expensive or inaccessible with their particular laptop) (Rice & Cummings, 2020. "Deselection criteria"). Wisneski (2008) offers advice which applies to both physical and digital collection development: librarians who seek input from expert outsiders, including publishers, database companies, and faculty, are able to develop their collection and establish important working connections at the same time (p. 151). </p>
        
        <h4> <span style="font-weight:bold;"> Evaluation: </span> </h4>
        <p> Library professionals can evaluate their collection development and preservation using the guidelines established by professional library organizations. IFLA (the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions) released a set of issues that can occur in e-resources in a library's collection. Additionally, ALA (American Library Assocation) has a subcommittee devoted to collection development librarians, and developed a guide for training librarians in this role. And, the Library of Congress offers an introduction to writing collection policy statements. By staying connected to other libraries and library organizations, LIS professionals can evaluate their own library collections. </p>
            
        <h4> <span style="font-weight:bold;"> Organization: </span></h4>
        <p> Organization of library collections requires training, as well as the use of development tools. Wisneski provides a list of tools and resources: spreadsheets, bibliographic software, vendors, and book review sites. This is primarily for internal collection organization. The library workshop I attended also recommended learning to use the items on Wisneski's list, and I reviewed this workshop in my first piece of evidence. External library collection organization involves the circulation of collection content. Well-organized circulation is a reliable system that patrons can use easily. Proper library organization makes the library easy to access and represents the library's content in a welcoming way. </p>
            
        <h4> <span style="font-weight:bold;"> Preservation: </span></h4>
        <p> Physical preservation includes protection against wear, temperature, humidity, pests, mold, and storage location. Digital preservation consists of making copies and backups of digital content, in order to protect against linkrot and computer damage (Brown, 2021, Stage four). Libraries should have preservation plans for general maintenance as well as potential disasters and emergencies that may strike and require immediate control (Brown, 2021). </li>

        </ul>
        <h3 id="evidence"> Evidence </h3>

        <h4> 1) Observation report: Filling your library shelves </h4>
        <a href="includes/observational assignment.pdf"> <img src="images/mail.png" style="width:150px; height:150px; display:block;"> Observation report </a>
        <p> In this observation report, I describe a library workshop I attended, in which a school and public librarian details how she selects content for her library shelves, and helps increase the quantity of literature on her library shelves. </p>
        <p> I chose to attend this particular workshop because I didn't have prior training in collection development or expansion. Laura Jones, the librarian who led this workshop outlined several ways to obtain free books for a physical collection: book givaways, surveys, reviews, swaps, committees and pre-publication copies. This workshop was both creative and practical. And the methods Laura Jones outlined for collection expansion also help LIS professionals become more familiar with and involved in the trends and developments within their collection topics. Since Laura Jones is a public and school librarian, her focus was on obtaining children's, tween and young adult novels. By participating in these different book and publishing events, Laura Jones better understood which authors and publishers were up-and-coming. This helped Laura improve at selecting which books would best supplement her library collection. </p>
        <p> Additionally, by writing reviews and staying active on social media, Laura Jones saw her library institutions receive more recognition from publishers, authors, companies and online platforms. Finally, if librarians enjoy writing and blogging about books, they can find paid opportunities to publish their work in magazines, journals and online platforms. </p>
        <p> I included my reflection in this competency because I gained great insight to library collection selection by attending this workshop. </p>

        <h4> 2) Paper: OAIS (Open Archive Information System) Mapping </h4>
        <a href="includes/OAIS Mapping - paper.pdf"> <img src="images/mail.png" style="width:150px; height:150px; display:block;"> OAIS Paper </a>
        <p> I wrote this paper entitled: "OAIS Mapping: MetaArchive" in INFO 259: Preservation Management. In this paper, I analyze OAIS, the current guide to digital organization and preservation. </p>
        <p> Through writing this paper, I learned that digital resources require storage and access maintenance. MetaArchive is a cooperative among academic universities. Rather than each university hold, store and preserve its own digital resources, this collection of universities uses MetaArchive to store several copies of its digital resources on different servers so that its content doesn't get lost, yet can remain easily accessible. I note in this paper that MetaArchive is a more "collaborative" digital preservation effort than seen previously, which indicates that LIS professionals are also learning how digital preservation works. MetaArchive saves seven copies of each digital item, following LOCKSS (Lots of copies keeps stuff safe). The cooperative also has specific rules in place to monitor (and ultimately permit) changes made to digital items. </p>
        <p> I chose to include this piece of evidence in this competency because it demonstrates my ability to understand the nuances of digital organization and preservation. </p>

        <!-- <h4> 3) Report: Physical library environment report <img src="images/mail.png" style="width:150px; height:150px; display:block;"> </h4>
        <a href="includes/Environment Report.pdf"> Environment report </a>
        <p> In this paper, I offer solutions to potential problems within a physical library environment that could damage a library's collection, or negatively affect its preservation. </p> --> 

        <h4> 3) Final project: Preservation Assessment </h4>  
        <a href="includes/comp_a/Sadie Davenport_Final project_.pdf"> <img src="images/mail.png" style="width:150px; height:150px; display: block"> State Indian Museum: Preservation Assessment</a>
        <p> My third piece of evidence is my preservation assessment of the State Indian Museum, where I work. This assignment was the culmination of what I learned in INFO 159: Preservation Management. </p>
        <p> I was incredibly grateful for the opportunity to assess the preservation practices of a real museum with a unique background and several different kinds of physical items in its collection. Elements of the museum I assessed include: the museum building, its displays, cultural items and books. Cultural items include: California Native American clothing, jewelry, tools, weapons, a canoe, baskets, photographs, and art. I outlined the history of the building and its effects on the collection: the State Indian Museum buildings was constructed in 1914, prior to the first uniform building code in California, and has several problems that make it very difficult to keep fragile items like baskets, clothing and feathers on display. These problems include: a leaky roof, improper lighting, and frequent bug infestations (not serious infestations, but any signs of infestations threaten our collection and are stopped immediately). Getting to understand this building and the inner functions of collection preservation was a unique, hands-on learning opportunity. </p>
        <p> I included this piece of evidence to show how I've applied the preservation skills I learned in INFO 259: Preservation Management to the evaluation of a real, historical museum building. </p> <br>

        <h3 id="conclusion"> Conclusion </h3>

        <p> Physical and digital selection, evaluation, organization, and preservation are difficult steps to conduct in collection development. First, there are different kinds of physical and digital items within a library. These items include tools, multimedia sources, literature, and more. With the support of library organizations, education systems like this program, and outsiders like publishers, faculty and authors, LIS professionals can improve their collection practices and build important connections. In the future, I plan to improve at collection development and preservation by staying up-to-date on current library collection procedures, and by strengthening my working relationships with publishers, faculty and digital database platforms. This way, I can understand the content as well as its organization within my library. </p>
