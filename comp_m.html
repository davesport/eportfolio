        <h3 id="intro"> Introduction </h3>
        <p> Developing leadership and communication skills takes place through experience. I've learned through my leadership experiences to work alongside the people I lead, empathize with those I lead, lead with generosity and kindness, lead by positive reinforcement, understand my group members' motivations, be willing to take on responsibility for both the good and bad outcomes of leadership, and set a sustainable working pace as a leader. For me, these learning lessons have stemmed from increased and improved communication with others, both when led by others, and when working as a leader. My communication and leadership skills complement one other. I noticed that as I became a better communicator, more of my colleagues listened to me and understood my ideas. I strongly believe that communication is essential for anyone who wants to bear leadership responsibilities. My experiences expanding and improving both my leadership and communication skills are organized in chronological order. </p> <br>

        <h4> Inside sales training </h4>
        <img src="images/mail.png" id="train" style="width:150px; height:150px; display: block;"> <a href="includes/comp_m/trainingprogress.pdf"> Call Center Training, April 2020 </a> </img> 
        <p> Prior to starting this MLIS program, I worked in the pest control industry. I started building my leadership and communication skills here, primarily. I spent my summers off from college and a year after my college graduation in Official Pest Prevention's call center. The pest control field is fascinating and complex. My role changed in their call center as I learned more about the company and improved at communicating with and educating customers about pest control service. </p>
        <p> In spring 2020, during the last few months before I started the MLIS program, I was responsible for training employees to successfully tackle after-hours call center shifts. This was tricky, since this shift was everyone's least favorite to work. Those who call after-hours for pest control assistance are usually facing an urgent pest-related issue and are not happy to be in a situation that requires calling us. However, these issues are important to navigate well, since a good responder in the call center can identify the problem, determine the best solution, and ultimately improve the quality of living for those facing pest issues. </p>
        <p> My goal was to make this shift more manageable and more successful for my coworkers. I've attached a table below that shows a month-long window into my training sessions with my coworkers. We practiced communication skills by listening to recorded phone calls and by practicing phone calls aloud. This was also tough and slightly (needlessly) embarrassing, as many people don't like listening to recordings of their voice. </p>
        <p> Above, in my notes on my coworkers' training, I demonstrate: an understanding of my coworkers' needs and emotions, a willingness to support my coworkers with additional information and exercises, and even an awareness of my own shortcomings as a trainer and leader. By making a little calendar like this, I could more easily keep track of each employee's individual progress and tailor the training to suit their needs. Over time, I was proud to watch my coworkers really improve and come out of their shells as after-hours call center professionals. This experience helping my coworkers really taught me that leaders learn along with people under their guidance. </p>
        
        <h4> Team building project </h4>
        <img src="images/mail.png" id="teamwork" style="width:150px; height:150px; display: block;"> <a href="includes/comp_m/GGardner_203_Teamwork Assignment.pdf"> INFO 203 Teamwork Assignment </a>
        <p> This team building project was the first assignment I completed in this MLIS program, and one of my more memorable learning experiences thus far. This team building project was to establish a working group system, only. There was no actual team project, we were just supposed to discuss working as a team. By discussing aloud what was important to each of us, and listening to one another, we were able to clarify many aspects of teamwork that formerly felt daunting. This assignment introduced me to new communication skills essential to group leadership. These communication skills include: expressing work values of importance to me, listening to others express their work values, and discovering ways to connect both mutual and separate values. In this project, my project partners and I listed our values, discussed their meaning and significance, and determined how to combine all of our values into a coherent and organized group foundation. </p>
        <p> Mark Ray writes in his article that "powerful and effective leaders share leadership with others..." and that "success should be shared among stakeholders" <a href="#ray"> (Ray, 2018. p. 27-28). </a> </p>
        <h4> ALASC & leadership role within the group </h4>
        <img src="images/mail.png" id="alasc" style="width:150px; height:150px; display: block;"> <a href="includes/comp_m/SJSU Mail - Communication schema ALASC.pdf"> Communication schema </a> </img>
        <p> Above is an email sent from Carlos, the ALASC Chair, discussing how he and I decided to split the monthly check-in sessions with individual ALASC executive members. </p>
        <img src="images/mail.png" id="alasc2" style="width:150px; height:150px; display: block"> <a href="includes/comp_m/SJSU Mail - Saying hey ◡̈.pdf"> Communication example </a></img> 
        <p> Above is one email chain from my September 2021 check-in. </p>
        <p> I am in charge of deliberately reaching out to half our board members each month, inquiring about their current work, their goals for the month, any issues or frustrations they've had, any challenges they face, and anything they're excited about working on. There aren't any expectations for these check-ins, and they are optional for the board members to participate in. By having an informal conversation between board meetings, Carlos and I have gotten to know our board members much better, and have facilitated a more sincere and genuinely positive environment in our board meetings. </p>     
        <p> Background for my involvement in ALASC: In May 2021, I was elected co-chair of SJSU's American Library Association Student Chapter (ALASC). This was my first official leadership position related to library science, and at the time, I didn't know how much I would need to learn to become a helpful and supportive leader for this group. I was grateful to work with the chair of ALASC and discuss group plans, meetings, events and issues together. By implementing the ideas that the chair and I discussed, we both learned how to believe in our leadership and initiate forward momentum within our group. This way, we motivated the other executive board members, and hosted events that supported MLIS and ALA students. </p>
        <p> As these conversations are informal and intentionally unrecorded, I chose these emails as written evidence that I learned to establish and maintain consistent communication with my ALASC board members, who were under my leadership. </p>
        <p> </p>

        <h3 id="conclusion"> Conclusion </h3>
        <p> Leadership and communication are two important qualities for a librarian to develop and grow. What both leadership and communication have in common is that they're most often learned through experience. Personally, I learned good leadership and communication habits in my MLIS courses, but understood each much more when faced with a situation in which leadership or communication was necessary. My experiences as a leader in the workplace and in the ALA student chapter helped me learn how connected leadership and communication are. Partly, I agree with Ray's (2018) argument that leadership is "shared" among the people you work with, which to me means that good leadership is essentially thoughtful teamwork (p. 27). More recently, I attended the 2022 LibLearnX Conference via Zoom and learned that librarians are still studying and discussing ways to become better leaders and communicators. I had the pleasure of talking to active librarians about their leadership and teamwork experiences. While they offered good advice, they were also honest about the aspects of teamwork and communication that they still struggle with. I expect to continue learning about leadership and communication throughout my library career. </p>
