        <h3 id="intro"> Introduction </h3>
        <p> Leadership and communication are two aspects of librarianship that complement one another, and are learned thoughout a career. Library scholars like <a href="ray"> Ray (2018)</a> state that leadership is essentially effective teamwork. <a href="#schlak">Schlak (2022)</a>  and <a href="#heck"> Heckman (2022)</a> each emphasize trust as an essential aspect of the leader-library teamwork relationship. Communicative terms are used to describe leadership because it is "dynamic," meaning that a leader and those under leadership work together for a common goal <a href="schlak"> (Schlak 2018, p. 235).</a> These assessments of leadership show how essential it is for a leader to demonstrate clear communication skills. Trust, bridge-building, inspiration, and guidance are conveyed through deliberate communication. I personally have noticed that as I become a better communicator, more of my colleagues listen to me and understand my ideas. I strongly believe that communication is essential for anyone who wants to bear leadership responsibilities. </p>
        <p> My experiences expanding and improving both my leadership and communication skills are organized in chronological order. I have learned about leadership and communication in my <a href="#teamwork"> coursework,</a> and have practiced what I've learned in leadership roles at <a href="#train"> work</a> and in <a href="#alasc"> ALASC</a> (American Library Association Student Chapter). Through my coursework and field experience, I've learned that leadership requires: empathy, teamwork, clear communication, patience, and an understanding of your team members' responsibilities. These learning lessons are explained in more detail below. </p> <br>

        <h4> Inside sales training </h4>
        <a href="includes/comp_m/trainingprogress.pdf"><img src="images/mail.png" id="train" style="width:150px; height:150px; display: block;"> Call Center Training, April 2020 </img> </a>
        <p> In spring 2020, during the last few months before I started the MLIS program, I was responsible for training employees to successfully tackle after-hours call center shifts. At this time, and for several years prior, I worked in the pest control industry. I spent my summers off from college and a year after my college graduation in Official Pest Prevention's call center. The pest control field is fascinating and complex. My role changed in their call center as I learned more about the company and improved at communicating with and educating customers about pest control service. </p>
        <p> Taking charge of this training was tricky, since the after-hours shift was everyone's least favorite to work. Those who call after-hours for pest control assistance are usually facing an urgent pest-related issue and are not happy to be in a situation that requires calling us. However, these issues are important to n davigate well, since a good responder in the call center can identify the problem, determine the best solution, and ultimately improve the quality of living for those facing pest issues. </p>
        <p> My goal was to make this shift more manageable and more successful for my coworkers. I've attached a table below that shows a month-long window into my training sessions with my coworkers. We practiced communication skills by listening to recorded phone calls and by practicing phone calls aloud. This was also tough and slightly (needlessly) embarrassing, as many people don't like listening to recordings of their voice. </p>
        <p> Above, in my notes on my coworkers' training, I demonstrate: an understanding of my coworkers' needs and emotions, a willingness to support my coworkers with additional information and exercises, and even an awareness of my own shortcomings as a trainer and leader. By making a little calendar like this, I could more easily keep track of each employee's individual progress and tailor the training to suit their needs. Over time, I was proud to watch my coworkers really improve and come out of their shells as after-hours call center professionals. This experience helping my coworkers really taught me that leaders learn along with people under their guidance. </p>

        <h4> Team building project </h4>
        <a href="includes/comp_m/GGardner_203_Teamwork Assignment.pdf"><img src="images/mail.png" id="teamwork" style="width:150px; height:150px; display: block;"> INFO 203 Teamwork Assignment </img> </a> 
        <p> This team building project was the first assignment I completed in this MLIS program, and one of my more memorable learning experiences thus far. This team building project was to establish a working group system, only. There was no actual team project, we were just supposed to discuss working as a team. By discussing aloud what was important to each of us, and listening to one another, we were able to clarify many aspects of teamwork that formerly felt daunting. This assignment introduced me to new communication skills essential to group leadership. These communication skills include: expressing work values of importance to me, listening to others express their work values, and discovering ways to connect both mutual and separate values. In this project, my project partners and I listed our values, discussed their meaning and significance, and determined how to combine all of our values into a coherent and organized group foundation. </p>
        <p> Mark Ray writes in his article that "powerful and effective leaders share leadership with others..." and that "success should be shared among stakeholders" <a href="#ray"> (Ray, 2018. p. 27-28).</a>  This team building assignment was just that: we determined the organization of the team together, assigned each other respective and suitable responsibilities, and determined a working schedule. This process taught me how effective leaders are able to communicate well with their peers. If a leader understands the strengths, weaknesses and hopes of the members in their group, they can facilitate a positive working environment in which everyone contributes toward the end product. </p>

        <h4 id="alasc"> Leadership as ALASC Co-chair </h4>
        <a href="includes/comp_m/SJSU Mail - Communication schema ALASC.pdf"> <img src="images/mail.png" id="alasc" style="width:150px; height:150px; display: block;"> Communication schema </img> </a>
        <p> Above is an email sent from Carlos, the ALASC Chair, in which he explains to our members how he and I decided to split the monthly check-in sessions with individual ALASC executive members. I included this email despite Carlos writing it, because this email shows our deliberate plan and schedule for leadership communication. </p>
        <a href="includes/comp_m/SJSU Mail - Saying hey ◡̈.pdf"> <img src="images/mail.png" id="alasc2" style="width:150px; height:150px; display: block">  Communication example </img> </a>
        <p> Above is one email chain from my September 2021 check-in (to show my involvement in deliberate, scheduled leadership communication). This is explained further below. </p>
        <p> I am in charge of deliberately reaching out to half our board members each month, inquiring about their current work, their goals for the month, any issues or frustrations they've had, any challenges they face, and anything they're excited about working on. There aren't any expectations for these check-ins, and they are optional for the board members to participate in. By having an informal conversation between board meetings, Carlos and I have gotten to know our board members much better, and have facilitated a more sincere and genuinely positive environment in our board meetings. </p>     
        <p> Background for my involvement in ALASC: In May 2021, I was elected co-chair of SJSU's American Library Association Student Chapter (ALASC). This was my first official leadership position related to library science, and at the time, I didn't know how much I would need to learn to become a helpful and supportive leader for this group. I was grateful to work with the chair of ALASC and discuss group plans, meetings, events and issues together. By implementing the ideas that the chair and I discussed, we both learned how to believe in our leadership and initiate forward momentum within our group. This way, we motivated the other executive board members, and hosted events that supported MLIS and ALA students. </p>
        <p> As these conversations are informal and intentionally unrecorded, I chose these emails as written evidence that I learned to establish and maintain consistent communication with my ALASC board members, who were under my leadership. </p>

        <h3 id="conclusion"> Conclusion </h3>
        <p> Leadership and communication are two important qualities for a librarian to develop and grow. What both leadership and communication have in common is that they're best understood with experience. In my courses, I learned important lessons from library leaders; however, I understood leadership and communication much more when responsible for showing proper leadership or communication within a group. Library leaders in my courses introduced me to new ways of communication and leadership, mainly: planning a team's schedule and roles, communicating clearly and positively with group members, and working alongside group members even when tasked with leadership. My experiences as a leader in the workplace and in the ALA student chapter helped me learn how to implement these leadership and communication skills learned in my coursework. </p>
        <p> Through my experiences, I have come to understand leadership as something that is "shared" among the people you work with, meaning that leadership is essentially thoughtful teamwork (Ray, 2018, p. 27). From this perspective, I view leadership and communciation as skills that an be improved throughout a lifetime. I've heard this echoed by other library professionals, as well. When I attended the 2022 LibLearnX Conference via Zoom, I saw firsthand that librarians are still studying and discussing ways to become better leaders and communicators. I had the pleasure of talking to active librarians about their leadership and teamwork experiences. While they offered good advice, they were also honest about the aspects of teamwork and communication that are still difficult and frustrating. I expect to continue learning about leadership and communication throughout my library career. </p>
